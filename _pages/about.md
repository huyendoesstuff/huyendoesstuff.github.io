Hi! It's Huyen here. I love writing and I wanted to have a simple themed blog, so here we are.

I'm organizing many aspects in my life, so I create stuff when I feel like it, especially when I don't find the
existing platforms fit my purpose anymore. I also like things that can be customized according to my needs, so say a
little bye bye to wordpress and blogger and medium (with big amount of gratitude of course!), you guys were so nice
to me in the past but I will have (and code) my own blog now.

Feels great isn't it ðŸ˜Š

Update: Excerpt from [a recent visit in  October 2021]({% link _posts/2021-10-12-a-while.md %})

> I need to build the site with `jekyll build`, then take whatever within the `_site` folder only and put them in the
branch for deploying. I was doing it all wrongâ€”no wonder why it didn't work as I expected.

### Featuring:

- Books (new!) ðŸŒŸ
- Movies/Series
- Mostly my unorganized thoughts
