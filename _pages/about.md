Hi! It's Huyen here. I love writing and I wanted to have a simple themed blog, so here we are.

I'm organizing many aspects in my life, so I create stuff when I feel like it, especially when I don't find the
existing platforms fit my purpose anymore. I also like things that can be customized according to my needs, so say a
little bye bye to wordpress and blogger and medium (with big amount of gratitude of course!), you guys were so nice
to me in the past but I will have (and `code`) my own blog now.

#### Featuring:

- Books (new!) ðŸŒŸ
- Movies/Series
- Mostly my unorganized thoughts

Feels great isn't it ðŸ˜Š

#### Update:

Update **July 2025**: I set up [GitHub action](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to update `main` branch automatically as I push new commits to `source`. The following manual is no longer needed.

Excerpt from [a recent visit in  **October 2021**]({% link _posts/2021-10-12-a-while.md %})

> I need to build the site with `jekyll build`, then take whatever within the `_site` folder only and put them in the
`master` branch for deploying. I was doing it all wrongâ€”no wonder why it didn't work as I expected.
