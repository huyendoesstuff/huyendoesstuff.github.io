Hi! It's Huyen here. I love writing and I wanted to have a simple themed blog, so here we are.

I'm organizing many aspects in my life, so I create stuff when I feel like it, especially when I don't find the
existing platforms fit my purpose anymore. I also like things that can be customized according to my needs, so say a
little bye bye to wordpress and blogger and medium (with big amount of gratitude of course!), you guys were so nice
to me in the past but I will have (and code) my own blog now.

Feels great isn't it ðŸ˜Š

### Featuring:

- Books (new!) ðŸŒŸ
- Movies/Series
- Mostly my unorganized thoughts
