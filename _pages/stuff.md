title: Do I do stuff, even...

Yup. I guess I do.

🎶

I play the ukulele, baritone ukulele and a little bit guitar, and I like to sing along. I have this little place on
soundcloud for all my
random moments:

At first I just put it all there, to save the moments for *me*. But later, there was this friend of mine who said to
me that she actually liked these audios. And listening to them... means something to her. It
warms my heart just thinking about that :)

Ah yes, this blog...

No doubts that I like writing -- The reason for the existence of this very page. Most importantly, how to put one
word after one another that closely reflect how I feel -- That's the beauty of the whole thing, learning to express
myself, and also learning about myself.

... Onto the professional stuff:

💻

I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science, doing research in Data Visualization. So basically I code and
make visualizations that reveal what data is trying to express.

My public code is at github: <https://github.com/huyen-nguyen>

📝

Um and I write manucripts - as a big part of research work. But this a is different kind of writing, which involves
less spontaneity and more rigorous methodology.
