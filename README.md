# huyendoesstuff

Hi! It's Huyen here. I like to write and wanted to have a simple-themed blog, so here we are: [huyendoesstuff.github.io](https://huyendoesstuff.github.io).

I also like doing stuff, hence the name.

The Jekyll theme is [Sidey](https://github.com/ronv/sidey).

Update **July 2025**: I set up [GitHub action](https://github.com/huyendoesstuff/huyendoesstuff.github.io/blob/source/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to update `main` branch automatically as I push new commits to `source`. Still, don't merge the two together.
