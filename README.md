Hi! It's Huyen here. I love writing and I wanted to have a simple themed blog, so here we are.

I also like doing stuff, hence the name.

The Jekyll theme is [Sidey](https://github.com/ronv/sidey).

Update July 2025: I set up [GitHub action](https://github.com/huyendoesstuff/huyendoesstuff.github.io/blob/source/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to update `main` branch automatically as I push new commits to `source`. The following manual is no longer needed.

As of October 2021: 

Usage:
- build in `source` branch
- copy `_site` folder to branch master

❌ DO NOT MERGE `source` and `master`❗
