Oh, hello, you!

It's been a while since the last time I was here. Oh, it's exactly 9 months: January 12 and October 12.
Interesting.

One new thing I learn since the last time I was here is that I need to build the site with `jekyll build`, then take only
whatever within the _site folder and put them in the branch for deploying. I was doing it all wrongâ€”no wonder why
it didn't work as I expected.

I moved back to the US. Things have been crazy in the last four months. So many things happened.

I teach now, so I guess I'm a teacher?! Still feel very fresh in the role. I'm truly happy I got to do what I love,
and I love what I do.

One thing I know now is that we learn better by **example**. If you never witness a woman lifts a 200-pound weight,
you may not even believe these kinds of thing happen. But it *is* true. You witness it, and you believe that a human
being can do it, and then you believe *you* can do it.

I recently got hooked with reddit. I feel like I can be mindful and intentional about the *topics* that I want to
see, instead of feeds with overflowing recommended contents or updates of someone whose life may not be of my
interest.
