My story is paced in a notebook,<br>
filled with unfinished, written, blank pages,<br>
torn at the crease, screaming<br>
to be different.<br>

I try to fit you in between the pages,<br>
as your sharp edge deepens the old wound<br>
and tears my scars anew.<br>
You said sorry, but that didn’t stop the edge from cutting,<br>
the skin from bleeding,<br>
the heart from hurting.<br>

The word ‘sorry’ coming out of your mouth,<br>
natural as a reflex,<br>
has shielded you from guilt one moment to the next,<br>
now an empty nothing once sweet. <br>

Perhaps it was you who depleted every ounce of its meaning <br>
one too many times.<br>
A hollow shell of broken intentions<br>
fell silently on my page,<br>
putting an end to our undone story.<br>
