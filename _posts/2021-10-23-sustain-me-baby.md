It's no *fun*, and it's no *excitement*. But I feel like it's the one thing that really **sustains** me. It's the only
thing that does not overwhelm me with guilt and self-loathing at the end of the day.

#### What is it?

> <div style="text-align: center">Discipline and intentionally choosing my values over my emotions.</div>

Even when it comes to self-care, when *emotion* feels so close to what I should do to maintain self-love, there's still
a fine line between values and feelings as to what I should choose to act on.

Three lines for these days:

1. Don't live in misery

2. Act on your values, not emotions

3. Take good care of yourself
