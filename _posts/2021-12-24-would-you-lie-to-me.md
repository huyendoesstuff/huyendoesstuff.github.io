Would you lie to me?<br>
Pretending that you care<br>
When I'm awfully lonely

Would you lie to me?<br>
Pretending that you're there<br>
When I'm facing my worst fear<br>
Of being abandoned, having no one near

Would you lie to me?<br>
Saying you want me close<br>
Even though you don't mean it<br>
I just needed<br>
to hear<br>
someone says it
