<i>Baby girl, you're gonna love again</i><br>
This time, it will be better than the last<br>
The shattered dreams, the broken pieces from the past<br>
Will be tender, and filled with love again<br>
The unnamed promises, hopeless romance<br>
Will be replaced by the warm presence of the heart<br>
and of the voice that says "I'm here."

My sweet, I once had this fear<br>
Of being an unlovable driftwood<br>
Holding on to any shore,<br>
calling it home,<br>
giving it my heart<br>
Time and time again<br>
Hope fades away, <br>
with rain and tears,<br>
with wind and shivers and hurts<br>
Then comes one day<br>
Autumn breeze tells me<br>
"Baby girl, you're gonna love again."
