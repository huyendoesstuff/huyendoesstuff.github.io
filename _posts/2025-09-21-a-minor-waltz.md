There are songs, poems, and paintings about romantic love; I wonder where all the great thinkersâ€™ stances are on friendship.

I returned to Boston after all my close friends moved away. It felt strangely similar to when I moved here exactly two years ago, starting anew, knowing no one.

Is it the feeling of impermanence? Or is it the hesitation to create new connections only to eventually lose them that makes me look at this wonder of a city with such wistful eyes?

I stood at Coolidge Corner today to watch the sunset. Time moved slowly enough for me to feel a quiet sense of longing.
