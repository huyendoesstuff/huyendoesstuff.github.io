I"G<p>It’s been uneasy for me to write this down, but because of the amount of gratitude I 
held dearly in my heart for the support I got from these sensational words, I decided to start this one.</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/radiantbutch/status/1346136160876302337">tweet</a> that has changed the game for me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>here’s to the people who’s trauma did not give them thick skin. the ones who became more sensitive and 
  insecure, who cry more easily, who get overwhelmed at small things. i’m so tired of the narrative that trauma makes you tough and untouchable. we’re survivors, not superheroes.</p>

<p>I was speechless and emotional after reading the statement. I have always been an emotional person. But this hit hard, 
and different. For the first time I feel like I’m free from the expectation where <em>I should be ok by now</em>, now that I understand I don’t 
necessarily have to end my story with a forced positive note.</p>
