I"à<p>Hi! Itâ€™s Huyen here. I love writing and I wanted to have a simple themed blog, so here we are.</p>

<p>I also like doing stuff, hence the name.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m organizing many aspects in my life, so I create stuff when I feel like it, especially when I donâ€™t find the 
existing platforms fit my purpose anymore. I also like things that can be customized according to my needs, so say a
 little bye bye to wordpress and blogger and medium (with big amount of gratitude of course!), you guys were so nice 
 to me in the past but I will have (and code) my own blog now.</p>

<p>Feels great isnâ€™t it ðŸ˜Š</p>
