It hurts me to see how Joel hurts Clem; assumptions building up to judgments eventually kill the image of the other person in your mind.Some of the scenes I like:      The scene with two kids: Baby girl in pink cow boy hat held baby Joel’s hand and walked him out away from the bullying kids.

It’s such a sweet scene.        The scene at the end of the erasing procedure, with the beach house:    What if you’d stay this time? Come back and make up a goodbye, at least.  Let’s pretend we had one.Let’s pretend we had one. Shall we? Gosh, how much I cried on this line.Joel told Clem that he was scared, that’s why he walked out the door. She didn’t know he was scared. He thought she knew that about him. It seems to me that this is the first time they were vulnerable with each other, and it happens to be at the end of their story, or at least the end of his memory about her that he wanted to erase.
